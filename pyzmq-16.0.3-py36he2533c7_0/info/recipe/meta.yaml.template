# On Windows ZeroMQ is bundled with pyzmq.
# On Windows pyzmq includes tweetnacl so libsodium is not used.
# We should revisit these in the future. However, packaging libsodium
# on Windows is complicated by the fact that they ship project files,
# but don't include one for VS 2008, which we would need for Python 2.7.

  # We run the zmq tests on all platforms except Windows.
  # The only reason not to run the tests on Windows is that
  # they terminate with an interactive prompt. See also
  # https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/292#issuecomment-208080893.
  #
  # Further: You need a lot of swap space (>=4GB probably) to run test_large_send
  # TODO :: Add code to test_large_send to disable it when there is not enough
  #         swap-space (maybe just extend the try: to cover the whole thing?)
  #         or else add a --have-large-mem arg:
